## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced responsive layout using grid. specially in the founder section where there is the portrait and a box of content overlapping the image. I can use a grid and set the two items on the same column and same row.

Using background image on the hero section for the spiral illustration. I can call several images and set their individual position.

```css
.hero {
  background-image: url(../assets/images/bg-pattern-1.svg),
    url(../assets/images/bg-pattern-2.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: calc(0% - 10rem), calc(100% + 5rem) calc(100% - 5rem);
}
```

### Continued development

Finetune the css to match the design
